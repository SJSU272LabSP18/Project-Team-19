#### Here is the project for you

#### Project Name: Social promotion of your business

Build a wrapper service using Twython API https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython to automatically handle tweets, search and retweets etc.. This service will read latest marketing images(with some texts) from a repository, could be google image store or box or something. service will also read latest blurbs (text with links) from a NOSQL database (couchdb)  or something. 
 
Persona/Use cases:

1. Employee:

The app interface provides people in an organization to subscribe. You could give them a twitter oauth button, with write permissions. They would be redirected to twitter an see a message "Allow Social Promotion App to tweet from your account?" that they could accept or deny. 

2. Marketing team: 

uses app interface to  easily upload the tweet blurbs and images they create on daily basis.

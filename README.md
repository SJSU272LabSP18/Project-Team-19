# Project-Team-19

# Idea 1:

Many restaurant across United States waste a lot of food on daily bases and many NGO’s struggle to provide food to poor and hungry people. Our idea is to create an app called “SAVE FOOD, SAVE LIVES” which will maintain a record for all the restaurants and NGO in town. Following will be the functionality of the app:
1. The restaurant and NGO can register into the website. 
2. A registered NGO will be able to search Restaurant which are registered in the site.
3.  A request for food can be made by the NGO and  the restaurant which accepts the request will deliver the food to the particular NGO or the NGO can collect the food from the Restaurant which accepted its request.


# Idea 2:

Project Idea: Create a webapp that combines user budget with food options

Scenario: The user is driving home after school and is hungry for cheese burger. The user has budgeted $100 for dining out this month and he has already spent $60 on food so far. The webapp takes into account the user's current left over budget for the month, location, food choice and recommends restaurants for budget food. In this case, the webapp would factor in the $40 left over to be budgeted for food this month and take the user's current location into account and suggest the best restaurant open at this time for Cheese burgers. The webapp satisfies both the user's palette and the wallet.

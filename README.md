## Project Idea 1
### Project title: 
Save food, Save lives
### Project description: Â  
Many restaurant across United States waste a lot of food on daily bases and many NGO's struggle to provide food to poor and hungry people. Our idea is to create an app called "SAVE FOOD, SAVE LIVES" which will maintain a record for all the restaurants and NGO in town. Following will be the functionality of the app:
"	The restaurant and NGO can register into the website. 
"	A registered NGO will be able to search Restaurant which are registered in the site.
"	A request for food can be made by the NGO and  the restaurant which accepts the request will deliver the food to the particular NGO or the NGO can collect the food from the Restaurant which accepted its request.
### Proposed methodology/ resources, etc:

## Project Idea 2
### Project title:  
Dinning on a budget
### Project description:   
The project aims to create a web app that combines user budget with food options
Scenario: The user is driving home after school and is hungry for cheese burger. The user has budgeted $100 for dining out this month and he has already spent $60 on food so far. The web app takes into account the user's current left over budget for the month, location, food choice and recommends restaurants for budget food. In this case, the web app would factor in the $40 left over to be budgeted for food this month and take the user's current location into account and suggest the best restaurant open at this time for Cheese burgers. The web app satisfies both the user's palette and the wallet.

## Project Idea 3( Took it from Prof.  Ranjan's blog)
### Project title:  
WeServe - Connecting  pro-bono and student volunteers to the NGOs around the world. 
### Project description: 
When NGOs start a social project they usually do not have resources to apply technology platform and best practices. So they often start with manual work and paper based system to collect  data and make decisions. They need help with things other than technology such as consulting, efficiency and applying proven techniques. This platform connects pro-bono consultants and students (high  school and college) volunteers to the NGOs. 
NGO posts the project. Students and pro  bono consultants creates their profile, interests and expertise and timeline they might be available to work/help. System applies intelligent algorithm to match them.
